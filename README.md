# LinkDrop

LinkDrop is a simple Laravel-based application that allows you to share media files or plain text easily. It’s a fun
personal project where I experimented with Laravel and Docker.

## Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose installed (recommended)

### Or, if you prefer to run the app without Docker:

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- A supported database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Node.js and Yarn

You’ll need to manually install dependencies, set up your `.env` file, run migrations, and serve the app via
`php artisan serve`.

## Getting Started

To get started, just run:

    docker-compose up -d --build

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Note

This project is a work in progress; the documentation and features may change.
